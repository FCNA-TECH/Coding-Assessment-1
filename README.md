# Coding-Assessment-1
This repository contains all my solutions to a coding assessment I have recently received, the whole assesment is made up of 3 questions with
the third question having 3 sub questions in it. I had around under 40 min to programme and submit all my solutions. 
All programmes are written in C#.


Question 1 (6 Marks) - A program is required to simulate rolling a die. 
The program should keep 'rolling the die' until a 6 is rolled. 
After the 6 is rolled, the program must display how many 'rolls' it took to get a 6.  

Question 2 (10 Marks) - Write a program which Will initially allow 
the user to enter a number between 1 and 100 and determine whether the 
number is ODD/ EVEN. You will need to write a function to return whether the 
number is odd or even, the main program should prompt user to enter number 
and validate the number and display the appropriate output. Odd or Even to 
indicate the number is Odd or Even. 

Question 3 (14 Marks) - 
" Days in a month: 
Thirty days hath September, 
April, June, and November; 
All the rest have thirty-one, 
Excepting February alone, 
And that has twenty-eight days clear 
And twenty-nine in each leap year. "

A program is required which outputs the number of days there are in the month which has been input by the user. 
The program should prompt the user to enter a month as a number and then prompt the user to enter a 4-digit year.  
The program should then display the number of days in that month. 

E.g., if the user enters 10 followed by 2017, 31 days should be displayed. 


Question 3 - Task 1: 
Write a program that will perform the tasks described above. A year is a leap year if: 
it is exactly divisible by 4 but is not exactly divisible by 100 except if it is exactly divisible by 400. 
(2016 and 2000 were both leap years but 1900 was not.)

Question 3 - Task 2: 
Extend the program so that it determines whether or not the input year is a leap year and outputs the correct number of days for February. 

Question 3 - Task 3: 
Test the program works by entering the following months and years: 
Month: 10	Year: 2017, 
Month: 6	Year: 2016, 
Month: 2	Year: 2017, 
Month: 2	Year: 2100, 
Month: 2	Year: 2000, 
Month: 2	Year: 2020
